## ETF Dashboard
This is an ETF dashboard that displays real-time ETF data. The project was made to help me 
learn how to practically use multi-threading and rendering the frontend with real-time data. Since I'm limited by the API I'm using, the dashboard only updates every 30 seconds which can be improved if I upgraded to the paid version of the API.

The project was built using React, Next.js, and Tailwind.
